```

- `assets/`: This directory holds all your resources, including texture images, audio files, map files, and any other assets your game uses.
- `src/`: This is where your source code files reside. Each major aspect of your game can have its own source file, like the game loop, player logic, map rendering, etc.
- `inc/`: Contains header files that correspond to each source file. This helps keep your code modular and allows you to separate declarations from implementations.
- `Makefile`: A file that contains build instructions for compiling your code. It helps automate the compilation process and produce executable files.
- `README.md`: A markdown file where you can provide project documentation, instructions, and explanations.
- `LICENSE`: A file containing licensing information for your project.
- `.gitignore`: A file that specifies which files and directories Git should ignore (like compiled binaries and temporary files).
- Other directories and files: You can create additional directories as needed, such as for fonts, additional levels, etc.

The `Makefile` example I provided in the previous response should work for this setup as well. Just make sure to update the `LIBS` variable in the `Makefile` based on the SDL2 libraries you need to link.
